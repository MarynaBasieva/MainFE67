               <h2>RTX 2070</h2>
               <p> The GeForce RTX 2070 is a high-end graphics card by NVIDIA, launched on October 17th, 2018. Built on the 12 nm process, and based on the TU106 graphics processor, in its TU106-400A-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce RTX 2070. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming video games. The TU106 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 445 mmÂ² and 10,800 million transistors. It features 2304 shading units, 144 texture mapping units, and 64 ROPs. Also included are 288 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 36 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 8 GB GDDR6 memory with the GeForce RTX 2070, which are connected using a 256-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1410 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1620 MHz, memory is running at 1750 MHz (14 Gbps effective).
                Being a dual-slot card, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 draws power from 1x 8-pin power connector, with power draw rated at 175 W maximum. Display outputs include: 1x DVI, 1x HDMI, 2x DisplayPort, 1x USB Type-C. GeForce RTX 2070 is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 3.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 229 mm x 113 mm x 35 mm, and it features a dual-slot cooling solution. Its price at launch was 499 US Dollars.</p>
