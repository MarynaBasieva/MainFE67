               <h1>The Punk Monk</h1>
               <p> People familliar with Playboi Carti's music would know that this isn't the first time that he has drawn inspiration from Pop Punk influences. With the cover of his previous 2018 album Die Lit showing the rapper stage diving into a crowd which was a reference to a photo that was taken of the British Punk band Charged GBH. With his photographer Nick Walker for the Die Lit cover saying how Playboi Carti's music goes against the grain, a lot like Punk music used to back in the day, Carti is into all sorts of different music so it was easy to pair the two aesthetics. As Walker used to listen to a lot of Punk and went to a lot of shows when he was younger, he was sure that they could execute a great photo in an authentic way. They played Punk music really loud and Carti threw himself into the air until they captured the perfect image to match the title.</p>
