               <h1>Keith Haring's Simplicity</h1>
               <p> The 1980s was the time of the AIDS crisis, the drugs epidemic and cold war, the space races. All these different competing pressures. Rampant capitalism. But also high unemployment. I think New York would've been a pretty broken down city in the 1980s after the crash. Despite all this, despite this sort of toxic swirl, with anti-apartheid and racism, he was creating positive symbols.

                'I think there was something about the idea of a radiant baby, flying saucer zapping somebody to create new life. I think there's something very optimistic about it. He wasn't criticising his time, he was trying to cut through
                it and just point to something more pure, I think.'
